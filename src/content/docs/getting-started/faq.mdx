## Basic Concepts

### 1. What is the C2PA?

**Short answer:** C2PA is an open standard for verifying the origin and editing history of digital content through cryptographically signed metadata.

**Details:** The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) provides a technical specification for embedding tamper-evident provenance information into images, videos, audio, and documents. It was formed in 2021 by merging Adobe's Content Authenticity Initiative and Microsoft/BBC's Project Origin.

### 2. How it works

**Short answer:** C2PA embeds a cryptographically signed "manifest" into media files containing information about creation, edits, and authorship. Any tampering breaks the signature.

**Technical flow:**
1. Content created → Manifest generated with metadata
2. Manifest signed with private key (like HTTPS certificates)
3. Manifest embedded in file
4. Content edited → Previous manifest becomes "ingredient"
5. New manifest created referencing old one
6. Chain of provenance preserved
7. Anyone can verify signature and detect tampering

### 3. What problems does C2PA solve?

**C2PA addresses:**
- **Misinformation**: Verify news photos/videos haven't been manipulated
- **AI content transparency**: Identify AI-generated or AI-modified content
- **Deepfakes**: Prove authenticity of real footage
- **Attribution**: Credit original creators
- **Copyright**: Demonstrate ownership and licensing
- **Trust erosion**: Restore confidence in digital media

### 4. Is C2PA the same as watermarking?

**No.** Key differences:

| Feature | C2PA | Watermarks |
|---------|------|------------|
| Visibility | Invisible metadata | Usually visible |
| Information | Rich structured data | Limited (usually just ID) |
| Tamper detection | Cryptographic signatures | Robustness varies |
| Removal | Easy to remove | Designed to resist removal |
| Standards | Open specification | Many proprietary formats |
| Purpose | Provenance verification | Ownership marking |

C2PA focuses on *transparency when present*, watermarks on *persistence when attacked*.

## Technical Questions

### 5. Can C2PA be removed?

**Short answer:** Yes, C2PA can be removed by stripping metadata, taking screenshots, or re-encoding. This is by design.

**Why it's acceptable:**
- C2PA proves authenticity *when present*, not prevents removal
- Absence of C2PA is itself informative (possible tampering)
- Goal is transparency, not DRM
- Platforms can flag content without provenance

**Analogy:** Like a seal on a medicine bottle - easy to break, but you know if it's been opened.

### 6. Does C2PA use blockchain?

**No.** C2PA uses traditional PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) - the same technology as HTTPS/SSL certificates.

**Key points:**
- Uses X.509 certificates and digital signatures
- No cryptocurrency, tokens, or transaction fees
- Works offline (no internet needed for verification)
- Much faster and simpler than blockchain
- Optional: Some implementations add blockchain timestamping as supplement

### 7. What file formats does C2PA support?

**Currently supported:**
- **Images**: JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, HEIC/HEIF, TIFF, DNG, SVG, GIF
- **Video**: MP4, MOV, AVI
- **Audio**: WAV, MP3, M4A
- **Documents**: PDF

**In development:** WebM, additional formats

### 8. How do I verify C2PA content?

**Easiest method:**
- Visit https://contentcredentials.org/verify
- Upload your file
- View provenance information

**Command-line:**
```bash
c2patool image.jpg
```

**Browser:** Install Content Credentials extension (Chrome/Edge)

**Programmatically:** Use C2PA SDKs (Rust, JS, Python, Go)

### 9. How do I add C2PA to my content?

**Using software:**
- Adobe Photoshop/Lightroom (built-in)
- Cameras: Nikon Z9/Z8, Leica M11-P, Sony Alpha series
- Command-line: `c2patool` (see docs)

**Requirements:**
- Certificate from trusted CA (DigiCert, GlobalSign, etc.)
- Or self-signed cert for testing

**See:** [Quick Start Guide](quick-start.md) for step-by-step instructions

## Hardware & Software

### 10. What is Nikon C2PA?

**Short answer:** Nikon is developing C2PA support for their cameras. The Z6 III is planned to receive C2PA firmware in 2025, enabling in-camera signing of photos with provenance metadata.

**Features (when available):**
- In-camera signing (no post-processing needed)
- Records camera model, serial number, settings, GPS
- Private key stored in secure hardware
- Verifies authenticity from moment of capture
- Ideal for photojournalism and legal evidence

**Note:** As of November 2025, Z9 and Z8 do not yet support C2PA despite earlier announcements.

### 11. Which cameras support C2PA?

**Currently available:**
- **Leica**: M11-P, SL3
- **Sony**: Alpha 1, A9 III, A7S III, A7 IV (with firmware update)

**In development:**
- **Nikon**: Z6 III (firmware planned for 2025)
- **Canon**: Exploring implementation

### 12. Which software supports C2PA?

**Creating C2PA content:**
- Adobe Firefly (automatic)
- Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom (manual opt-in during export, JPEG only, Early Access)
- Adobe Premiere Pro
- Capture One (via plugin)
- c2patool (command-line)

**Verifying C2PA:**
- Content Credentials Verify (web)
- c2patool (command-line)
- Browser extensions (Chrome, Edge)

## AI & Deepfakes

### 13. Can C2PA detect AI-generated images?

**Not automatically.** C2PA doesn't detect AI content - it records *what the creator declares*.

**How it works:**
- AI tools (like DALL-E, Adobe Firefly) can add C2PA manifest stating "AI-generated"
- Some tools (like Midjourney) use simpler IPTC metadata without C2PA verification
- Relies on honest disclosure by the AI service
- Proves the content came from that service (if signed)
- Doesn't detect undeclared AI content

**Complementary:** C2PA works with AI detection tools, not replaces them.

### 14. Does C2PA prevent deepfakes?

**No.** C2PA doesn't prevent deepfake creation, but helps identify real content.

**What C2PA does:**
- Proves *authentic* content is authentic (positive assertion)
- Shows provenance of real photos/videos
- Makes it harder to pass off manipulated content as original

**What it doesn't do:**
- Stop someone from creating deepfakes
- Detect deepfakes without provenance data
- Force people to use C2PA

**Strategy:** As authentic content adopts C2PA, content *without* C2PA becomes more suspicious.

### 15. How does C2PA label AI-modified content?

**Through assertions:**
- `c2pa.actions` records "AI enhancement" actions
- `digitalSourceType` can specify "trainedAlgorithmicMedia"
- Custom assertions for AI model info (optional)

**Example manifest entry:**
```json
{
  "action": "c2pa.edited",
  "digitalSourceType": "trainedAlgorithmicMedia",
  "softwareAgent": "Adobe Photoshop Generative Fill"
}
```

## Privacy & Security

### 16. Is my personal information exposed?

**You control what's included.**

**Optional information:**
- Creator name
- GPS location
- Custom metadata

**Always included:**
- File hash
- Timestamp
- Signature
- Certificate (identity depends on cert type chosen)

**Privacy tips:**
- Use organizational certs instead of personal ones
- Don't include GPS if location is sensitive
- Review manifests before publishing
- Use pseudonymous identities if needed

### 17. Can someone forge C2PA signatures?

**Very difficult, but not impossible.**

**Strong protection:**
- 2048-bit RSA or 256-bit ECDSA cryptography
- Private keys should be in HSMs (Hardware Security Modules)
- CAs verify identity before issuing certificates

**Risks:**
- Stolen private keys → revoke certificate immediately
- Compromised Certificate Authority
- Social engineering to obtain certificates

**Best practices:**
- Hardware-based key storage
- Regular certificate rotation
- Monitor for suspicious signatures

### 18. What happens if my signing key is stolen?

**Immediate actions:**
1. **Revoke certificate** through your CA
2. **Generate new key pair**
3. **Notify stakeholders**
4. **Review: check what was signed with compromised key**

**Impact:**
- Compromised key can forge your signature
- Past signatures may be distrusted
- Revocation status distributed through OCSP/CRL

**Prevention:**
- Store keys in HSM or secure enclave
- Use strong access controls
- Regular security audits

## Additional Common Questions

### Can C2PA work with older content?

**Yes,** you can retroactively add C2PA manifests to existing content.

**Limitations:**
- Can't prove when original was created (use current timestamp)
- No in-camera signature proof
- Still valuable for attribution and edit tracking going forward

### Does C2PA increase file size?

**Slightly.** Typically adds 10-50 KB per manifest, depending on:
- Number of assertions
- Embedded thumbnails
- Certificate chain length

**Negligible** for most use cases (< 1% increase for typical photos).

### Can I use C2PA for private/confidential content?

**Yes.** C2PA works fine with private content:
- Manifests are embedded, not published separately
- You control what metadata to include
- Signatures don't require public disclosure
- Verification can be done offline

### What about content behind paywalls?

C2PA works normally. The manifest travels with the file whether it's public or behind authentication.

### Does C2PA require internet connection?

**No** for basic verification:
- Manifest and signatures are in the file
- Certificate chain can be embedded
- Offline verification fully supported

**Optional** internet use:
- Check certificate revocation status (OCSP)
- Download trust lists
- Access cloud-based verification services

### How long do C2PA signatures remain valid?

**Indefinitely,** as long as:
- Certificate hasn't been revoked
- Cryptographic algorithms remain secure
- Trust anchor (root CA) is still trusted

**Note:** Certificate expiration doesn't necessarily invalidate past signatures (depends on implementation).

### Can I remove C2PA from my own content?

**Yes,** you can always remove C2PA metadata from your own files:
- You own the content and metadata
- Use metadata stripping tools
- Re-save in C2PA-free format
- Take screenshots/re-encode

### What if I don't trust a Certificate Authority?

**Options:**
- Use different CA you trust
- Implement custom trust anchors in your system
- Accept only specific certificates (pinning)
- Self-signed certs for closed ecosystems

**C2PA allows** multiple trust models, not just public CA system.
